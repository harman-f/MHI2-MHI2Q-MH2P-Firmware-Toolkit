## VW_Flash FRF rolling-XOR algorithm

The standalone `tools/frf_odx_extract.py` implementation of the FRF outer
rolling-XOR transform is based on `frf/decryptfrf.py` from
[`bri3d/VW_Flash`](https://github.com/bri3d/VW_Flash/tree/293f46d782bae2ced930497889b71eb782f122cb),
commit `293f46d782bae2ced930497889b71eb782f122cb`.

## Binary Refinery — NRV2B algorithm reference

The independent `tools/ucl_nrv2b.py` implementation was differentially checked
against Binary Refinery 0.11.2's `nrv2b` unit with an 8-bit reader. Its decoding
control flow was informed by the public implementation in
`refinery/units/compression/nrv.py` and bit-reader behavior in
`refinery/lib/decompression.py`. The decoder committed here is a bounded,
standalone implementation for QNX's 64-KiB IFS blocks; Binary Refinery itself
is not imported or required at runtime.
